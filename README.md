# Project 1 - Brewery Foolery

## Description

Brewery attendance has skyrocketed in the last handful of years, and we wanted to create a one-stop-shop for locating the right fit for you. As well as enjoy time with your friends and other brew-ficianados – with a fun game of trivia! This website accesses 2 versatile API's, with a plethora of data ready at your fingertips. Giving you three different criteria to filter search results on our brewery API: city, state, and zipcode it's easy to pinpoint a brewery close to you! Our trivia page offers 10 unique categories to choose from, and hides the correct answer until it's time to reveal. Endless entertainment!

## User Story

```
As a frequenter of breweries,
I’d like to explore my city’s breweries,
as well as other cities when I travel,
so I can broaden my beer-related horizons!
Once I am at the brewery,
I’d like to keep me and my friends entertained with a game of trivia with multiple categories.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
